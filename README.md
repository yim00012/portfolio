# portfolio

*In the UX Design course, I researched and visualized ideas for the portfolio website. I began developing the actual website based on the wireframe and prototype. Even if I consider development stages when wireframing, it is not easy because Bootstrap frameworks have such a diverse variety of customizing and developing aspects. I spent a lot of time searching and googling for the appropriate approach to use Bootstrap and trying to find some more ideas to develop them. This course has taught me more about HTML and CSS, as well as how to use them effectively.*
